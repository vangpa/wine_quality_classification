The purpose of this study is to employ machine learning algorithms in making the most accurate prediction of human wine taste preference given several physicochemical characteristics of red and white Vinho Verde wine. Experiments were conducted on datasets containing information about red and white Vinho Verde wine quality taken from the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. This study explores the use of classification algorithms, including logistic regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, Ensemble, Extra Trees, and Gradient Boosting, as well as Deep Neural Network (DNN), to accurately predict the sensory quality of each wine instance. Random Forest and DNN models proved to be two of the more accurate machine learning classification predictors.
